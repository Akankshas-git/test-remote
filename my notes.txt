What is Internet and How It Works Globally
The Internet is a global network that interconnects millions of private, public,
academic, business, and government networks worldwide. It uses the standard
TCP/IP protocol suite to allow communication between different systems and
networks.
It enables users to send and receive information in the form of data packets using
interconnected network devices and infrastructure.
Key Characteristics:
• The Internet is decentralized and made up of numerous independent
networks.
• It relies on a system of routers, switches, and protocols to transmit data.
• Every device connected to the Internet is identified by a unique IP address.
Working Overview:
1. Devices connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
2. Data packets are created and addressed with IP information.
3. Packets travel through multiple routers and switches.
4. Data can cross national boundaries via undersea optical fiber cables.
5. The target device receives and reconstructs the packet stream.
Submarine Optical Fiber Cables
Submarine cables are fiber optic cables laid beneath the sea to carry
telecommunication signals across continents. These are the backbone of
international Internet traffic.
Key Points:
• Made up of bundled glass fibers that transmit light pulses.
• Typically owned and maintained by telecom companies or global consortiums.
